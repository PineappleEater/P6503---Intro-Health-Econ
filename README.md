# Health Economics Exam 1 Preparation Project

## Overview

This project involved a comprehensive review and enrichment of study materials for the Health Economics Exam 1 (Weeks 1-4). The goal was to create a robust review document and a condensed cheat sheet for exam preparation.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. [Review_Weeks_1-4.md](file:///d:/OneDrive/Desktop/Academic/P6503---Health-Econ/Review_Weeks_1-4.md)

A deep-dive review document covering:

* **Week 1**: Introduction, Scarcity, Opportunity Cost, PPF.
* **Week 2**: Demand for Health, Grossman Model, Consumer Choice Theory (Indifference Curves, Budget Constraints), Demand Shifters, and Elasticities.
* **Week 3**: Supply, Production Functions, **Isoquants & Isocosts**, **Marginal Product & Calculus**, and Short-Run Cost Functions.
* **Week 4**: Market Analysis, Equilibrium, **Comparative Statics**, Government Interventions (Price Ceilings/Floors, DWL).
* **Example Problems**: Detailed step-by-step solutions for labor maximization, Cobb-Douglas optimization, and cost curve analysis.

## Methodology & Experience

### Process

1. **Analysis**: Initial review of the user's `Review_Weeks_1-4.md`.
2. **Gap Identification**: Compared the review doc against provided lecture slides (Weeks 1-4). Identified missing "hard" theory components like Isoquants, Cost Minimization rules ($MP_L/MP_K = w/r$), and specific Demand Shifters.
3. **Enrichment**: Systematically updated the Markdown file to include these missing theoretical foundations, ensuring that every method used in the example problems was first explained in the theory sections.
   * *Specific Fix*: Added a "Calculus Note" to explain the derivative relationship for Marginal Product, linking theory to the Cobb-Douglas example.
4. **Cheat Sheet Creation**:
   * Drafted initial content in Markdown.
   * Converted to LaTeX for superior formatting and space optimization.
   * Iteratively refined the LaTeX code (font 10pt, margins 0.2in, tight spacing) to ensure it fits strictly on one page while remaining legible.

### Key Tools Used

* **LaTeX**: For creating the professional-grade cheat sheet.
* **Markdown**: For the primary review document.
* **Calculus**: Applied to Cobb-Douglas production functions for optimization.

## Future Recommendations

* **Practice**: Use the "Example Problems" in Week 4 of the review doc to test your understanding of the calculus applications.
* **Verification**: Always cross-reference the cheat sheet formulas with the exam requirements.
